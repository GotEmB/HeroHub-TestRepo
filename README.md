## Continuum â€” Plot
Why? Because I need to commit something.

So let's start.

When a group of rebels convicted as terrorists escapes execution by fleeing from the year 2077 to 2012, Kiera Cameron (Rachel Nichols), a future Vancouver law enforcement officer (called Protector), is involuntarily transported with them.
In order to track them down and keep them from changing the past (and presumably future), Kiera joins the local police force and uses the skills of a young tech expert, Alec Sadler (Erik Knudsen).
The future of 2077 is a dystopian one in which world governments have collapsed and corporations now dominate the planet, instituting a high-surveillance police state and removing many basic social freedoms.
The moral dilemma this presents is that the group of eight from 2077 (who call themselves "Liber8"), while self-admittedly having killed tens of thousands of people as colateral, consider themselves to be freedom fighters against the Orwellian corporate regime that dominates their time.

After Kiera goes back in time, she finds out that she can communicate with a young Alec Sadler using her wireless technology.
Sadler is famous in her time for inventing this technology.
However, in sixty years' time, an elderly Alec Sadler is actually the head of the mega-corporation Sadtech, whose technology may (inadvertently or otherwise) have been used to send Kiera and the others back in time.

## Continuum â€” Plot
Why? Because I need to commit something.

So let's start.

When a group of rebels convicted as terrorists escapes execution by fleeing from the year 2077 to 2012, Kiera Cameron (Rachel Nichols), a future Vancouver law enforcement officer (called Protector), is involuntarily transported with them.
In order to track them down and keep them from changing the past (and presumably future), Kiera joins the local police force and uses the skills of a young tech expert, Alec Sadler (Erik Knudsen).
The future of 2077 is a dystopian one in which world governments have collapsed and corporations now dominate the planet, instituting a high-surveillance police state and removing many basic social freedoms.
The moral dilemma this presents is that the group of eight from 2077 (who call themselves "Liber8"), while self-admittedly having killed tens of thousands of people as colateral, consider themselves to be freedom fighters against the Orwellian corporate regime that dominates their time.

After Kiera goes back in time, she finds out that she can communicate with a young Alec Sadler using her wireless technology.
Sadler is famous in her time for inventing this technology.
However, in sixty years' time, an elderly Alec Sadler is actually the head of the mega-corporation Sadtech, whose technology may (inadvertently or otherwise) have been used to send Kiera and the others back in time.
Young Alec points out that there are essentially two possibilities.
The first is that this is a time loop, and elderly Alex in 2077 had already met Kiera, remembered everything they did together, and was possibly even inspired to create cybernetic technology from encountering "his" future work in her implants.
In this case, nothing can be changed, and the mega-corporations will still dominate the planet in 2077.
The second possibility is that the time travel of the terrorists and Kiera has altered the pre-existing timeline, and due to their intervention it is no longer certain what 2077 will be like.
The first possibility more closely matches the fact that the 2077 version of Alec Sadler was the only witness to the escape of the Liber8 who seemed totally unsurprised as events unfolded early in episode one.
Yet another possibility is that Old Alec, based on his earlier experiences (as Young Alec), knew that the rebels would make the time jump, and that he actually supports their actions.
